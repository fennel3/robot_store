# robot_store
This project is a robot merchandise store built with PHP and an SQL database. It serves as a showcase of my ability to organise and structure code following the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). The project demonstrates skills in database management, backend development, and adherence to best practices in software design.
